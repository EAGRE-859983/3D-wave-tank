# External data for TC4

- In this folder you can find the experimental measurements of the open test case 202002 conducted at MARIN, which is used in TC4 for validation. Thanks to Dr. Tim Bunnik who shared the data with us. 
  - Data related to the piston wavemaker motion are recorded in `PistonMotion.dat`, `PistonVelocity.dat` and `PistonAcceleration.dat`.  
  - The free-surface elevations measured by six probes are recorded in files ranging from `WAVE_1.dat` to `WAVE_6.dat`, respectively.
  
- You can also find numerical results obtained from Elena's model. The free-surface elevations at six locations where the probes are placed are shown in files ranging from `wavemaker202002 0.dat` to `wavemaker202002 5.dat`.
